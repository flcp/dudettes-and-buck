**Cegirodis, eldest and only decendant of house Uandeyr, son of Laemrir**

Since he can remember, Cegirodis' parents were wealthy from trading local riches to far off lands. The city of Korsova served as the home base for their businesses, where they collected from farmers in the surrounding countryside and used chartered freighters to ship and sell their goods. While they did accumulate a decent amount of wealth, they were never rich beyond imagination and treated all business partners fairly.

They raised Cegi on the values of being thankful for what one has, being an honorable and just half-elf and, while they were completely agnostic, they always followed a strong moral code.

Being a half-elf in Korsova was no easy task and so, Cegi faced the everyday racism that every non-human in the city is subjected to. Deeply disappointed, Cegi turned to short-lived entertainment like gambling, prostitutes and throwing extravagant parties in order to gain some so called friends.

His mother - a caring, loving and helping personality who often walked the streets helping citizens that needed medical aid, contracted a rare illness when he was 17. Laemrir rallied healers from all corners of the continent, but no one could help her and alas, too weak to live on, she died in the families chambers.

After a period of mourning, the widowed family-father Laemrir focused all his attention towards financially and politically supporting the town's hospitals, healers and alike. No other head of family should have to suffer a devastating loss like he did, even if that meant that a big portion of the family's fortune would have to be spent.

Unfortunately, this good deed would be his demise. The underworld suffered, as their makeshift quacksalvers and alternative healing methods were no longer needed. Additionally, the multiplication of medical help greatly reduced the number of addicts, alcoholics and drug users. For this, a bounty was set upon Laemrir's head and one fateful night, while walking home, Gaedren Lamb cornered Laemrir and Cegirodis in a small alley and stabbed Laemrir to death. Cegirodis got saved by a man of faith, who stood fearlessly between the young adult and the attacker. Gaedren did not dare to wickedly kill an unarmed man of god and fled the scene. 

Cegi was devastated after losing both his parents over the span of a few years. The priest however had unknowingly kindled a small spark in him, that made him realise faith is not only the babbeling of old people but can act as a shield and sword that influences, saves and - at times - punishes.
From that day on, Cegi renounced the worldly, and took the oath of Iomedae, vowing to help the weak and those in need. He served in the temple's guard and learned the ways of the war.

Inspired by his mother, he seeks to cure all illnesses he encounters. While he gladly throws himself in way of the arm striking the helpless, his great hammer Dikaiosyne punishes every evil he comes across.
Being somewhat isolated in his youth, only having bought friends that did not offer grounds for fruitful discussions or finding his own character, he is still unsure of himself and at times - can act very awkward, naive and young. 
After a few years in the temple's guard, he is now on the lookout for the killer of this father. As a paladin of Iomedae, he does not adore violence or brutality, but Gaedren Lamb is not going to get a spoonful of mercy from Cegirodis Uandeyr, son of Laemrir.
